## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have the following software installed on your machine:

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (v20.10+)
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (v2.0+)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+ for local development)
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) (v1.22+)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/EleGee2/salon-scheduling-api.git
    cd salon-scheduling-api
    ```

2.  **Create the environment file**
    Copy the example environment file to create your own local configuration.
    ```bash
    cp env.sample .env
    ```
    Now, open the `.env` file and fill in the required values. See the [Environment Variables](#-environment-variables) section for more details.

3.  **Install local dependencies** (optional)
    While the application runs in Docker, you may need dependencies installed locally for your IDE or local tooling.
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

## üíª Usage

### Running the App for Development

The entire development environment is managed by Docker Compose.

1.  **Build and start the services**
    This command will build the Docker images and start the application and database containers in the background.
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```

2.  **View container logs**
    To see the logs from the running application container:
    ```bash
    docker-compose logs -f app
    ```

The application will be running and accessible at `http://localhost:3000`. The service supports hot-reloading, so any changes you make to the source code will automatically restart the server.

### Running Database Migrations

Database migrations are managed using TypeORM. They must be run from within the running `app` container.

* **To apply all existing migrations to the database:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose exec app yarn run migration:run
    ```

* **To generate a new migration:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose exec app yarn run migration:generate -- -n MigrationName
    ```

* **To revert the last migration:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose exec app yarn run migration:revert
    ```

### Stopping the Application

To stop all running containers:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

To stop and remove all data (including database):
```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

## üîå API Endpoints

### Services (`/services`)
- `POST /services` - Create a new service
- `GET /services` - List all services (with pagination)
- `PATCH /services/:id` - Update a service
- `POST /services/:id/staff` - Assign staff to a service
- `GET /services/:id/staff` - Get staff assigned to a service
- `GET /services/:id/availability` - Get availability for a service

### Staff (`/staff`)
- `POST /staff` - Create a new staff member

### Available Queries

```graphql
# Health check
query {

}

# Get availability for a service
query GetAvailability($serviceId: Int!, $date: String!) {
  availability(serviceId: $serviceId, date: $date) {
    staffId
    staffName
    availableSlots
  }
}
```

### Example GraphQL Query

## üìñ API Documentation

The API documentation is automatically generated using Swagger and is available when the application is running or can be accessed here https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/29390219/2sB34fohMV.

Navigate to http://localhost:3000/docs to view the interactive Swagger UI.

### Authentication

Most endpoints require API key authentication. Include your API key in the request headers:

```bash
curl -H "X-API-Key: your-secret-api-key" \
     http://localhost:3000/services
```
